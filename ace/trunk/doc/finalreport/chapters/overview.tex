\section{What is Collaborative Editing?}



\section{Use Cases of Collaborative Editing}



\section{Requirements of a Collaborative Application}
The following requirements have been identified for a synchronous collaborative
editing system by \cite{sun98achieving}.

\subsection{Real-time} 
The response to local user actions must be quick, ideally
as quick as a single-user editor. Imposing a global total order is not
an option because of the distributed nature of the system (i.e. network
latency). Thus, generally these systems replicate the document at each
user's site.

\subsubsection{Distributed} 
Cooperating users reside on different machines 
connected by communication networks with nondeterministic latency.

\subsubsection{Unconstrained} 
Multiple users are allowed to concurrently and
independently edit any part of the document at any time, in order to 
facilitate free and natural information flow among multiple users.



\section{Previous Work}
\label{sect:overview.previouswork}

\subsection{Semester Project}
In the semester project we have implemented the following things:
\begin{itemize}
 \item consistency control algorithm (\emph{Jupiter})
 \item test framework for algorithm
\end{itemize}

In the first stage of the semester project we evaluated different
consistency control algorithm. The \emph{Report Evaluation Algorithm}
documents the evaluation process. The implementation of the
algorithm is documented in \emph{Report Implementation Algorithm}. The
test framework is documented in \emph{Report Testframework}.

Futher, we did some research to find out how we want to implement the
network as well as the application layer. The results of this research
is documented in \emph{Report Evaluation Network} and 
\emph{Report Evaluation GUI} respectively.


\subsection{Summer Time}
During the summer break we tried to finish the implementation of undo/redo
in the algorithm. However, we stumbled across some issues that could not
be resolved in reasonable time. Read section \ref{sect:algorithm.undoredo} for
a detailed description of the problem.

We also investigated how difficult it would be to create a collaborative 
editing plugin for jEdit (see \href{http://jedit.org/}{http://jedit.org/}.
More about this investigation can be read in section 
\ref{sect:decisions.gui}.
