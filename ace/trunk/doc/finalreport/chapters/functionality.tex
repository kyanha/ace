The goal of the project ACE is to create a collaborative text editor. To achieve that goal the editor must satisfy basic text editor functionality as well as collaborative editor functionality. \\

A basic text editor must have features like create new, load and save documents. Further it would be userfriendly to have multiple documents open at the same time and switch between them. Operations like cut/copy/paste and undo/redo shouldnt be missing. A more detailed description of the goals can be found in the \textit{System Requirement: 2.1 Mandatory Goals}. See section \ref{sect:algorithm.undoredo} for a description about the lack of undo/redo in our editor.\\

Besides the basic text editor functions, a collaborative text editor must support the publication of documents. Published documents should be discovered automatically by all other users running a collaborative text editor in the same network. All users invited to a document by its owner (publisher) can read, write and delete the content of the published document. To counteract misbehaviour the publisher can kick invited users which results with a blacklist ed until they got a re-invite.

The owner should be also able to kick invited users 


Based on that facts we defined mandatory, optional and non-goals for our diploma work in \textit{System Requirements: Project Goals}. A description of the preview work can be found in \ref{sect:overview.previewwork}.
