\section{General}
When we decided which technology to use to implement the network layer, we did
not have a complex prototype based on the chosen technology. Bonjour itself
proved to be a good choice, however the beepcore Java library had some
bugs that caused serious problems in the implementation. We could have
avoided that situation by implementing a prototype that would have used
the framework in a similar manner as ACE. Thus, we learned that it is
always a good idea to make some thorough tests before using a framework
in a project.



\section{Mark Bigler}
First of all, it was a great time with a really cool and efficient team. I have got to know new frameworks like \textit{GlazedLists} and \textit{Springframework} which are very usefull for GUI programming. \\

Writing all documents in english was good a practise to improve my english skills which are a bit more fluent now. \\

Too bad, we didnt had the double amount of time so that we were able to realize more features to make ACE to a more pwoerfull tool.
\subsection{Positive Points}
\begin{itemize}
\item great time and experience
\item new frameworks usefull for GUI programming
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negative Points}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not enough time to make a ".." project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Self Criticism}
\begin{itemize}
\item ...
\end{itemize}



\section{Simon Raess}
The whole project ACE was a great success. We started from basically knowing
nothing about the topic to a working application. Although there are still
some open issues, we achieved the goals set at the beginning.


\subsection{Positive Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item we achieved the goals we set at the beginning in the amount of time
       we had
 \item through a clear separation of the layers we could work efficiently and independently
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negative Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item we did not implement a network simulator, which would have simplified testing greatly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Self Criticism}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
\end{itemize}
