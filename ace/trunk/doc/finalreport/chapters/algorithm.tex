\chapter{Algorithm}
\label{chapter:algorithm}

In this chapter we describe the algorithm used by ACE. We give a general
overview of the concepts. However, the interested reader is referred to
the documentation of the semester project for a detailed description (see 
\emph{Report Evaluation Algorithm}). This chapter is only intended to give
the reader enough information to understand the basic concepts and the
design decisions made in the implementation.



\section{Introduction}
Real-time cooperative editing systems allow multiple users to view and edit a
document at the same. The changes of other participants in an editing
session are immediately visible on the local screen. Consistency maintenance
is one of the most significant challenges in designing and implementing
these systems. Fortunately, researchers have found algorithms that solve the
problems present in these systems.


\subsection{Document Model}
In the following we assume a (conceptual) shared document model that consists 
of a sequence of characters, indexed from zero up to the number of characters in
the document minus one. The document state (i.e. the text) can only be 
modified by executing one of the following two primitive editing operations:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Insert(p, str): insert the String $str$ at position $p$
 \item Delete(p, len): delete $len$ characters starting at position $p$
\end{itemize}

Each participant in an editing session has a replica of the document, to which
he/she applies the changes.


\subsection{Preliminaries}
In this section, some basic concepts and terminologies are introduced. Following Lamport~\cite{lamport78}, we define a causal (partial) ordering relation on operations in terms of their generation and execution sequences as follows.

\begin{defn}
Causal ordering relation $\rightarrow$
\end{defn}

Given two operations $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$ generated at sites $i$ and $j$, then $O_{a}\rightarrow O_{b}$, iff:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $i=j$ and the generation of $O_{a}$ happened before the generation of 
       $O_{b}$
 \item or $i \neq j$ and the execution of $O_{a}$ at site $j$ happened before 
       the generation of $O_{b}$
 \item or there exists an operation $O_{x}$ such that $O_{a}\rightarrow O_{x}$
       and $O_{x}\rightarrow O_{b}$
\end{enumerate}

Note that the causal ordering relation is a \emph{partial ordering}.

\begin{defn}
Dependent and independent operations
\end{defn}

Given any two operations $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $O_{b}$ is \emph{dependent} on $O_{a}$ iff $O_{a} \rightarrow O_{b}$
 \item $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$ are \emph{independent} (also \emph{concurrent}), 
       expressed as $O_{a} \Arrowvert O_{b}$ iff neither 
       $O_{a}\rightarrow O_{b}$ nor $O_{b}\rightarrow O_{a}$
\end{enumerate}

Intuitively we can say that two operations are dependant if there exists a path from the generation of one message to the generation of another message. So for example in figure \ref{fig:example1} operation $O_{1}$ and $O_{3}$ are dependent, that is $O_{1}\rightarrow O_{3}$. Operation $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are independent ($O_1 \Arrowvert O_2$). 

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=2.5in,height=2.88in]{../images/finalreport/example1.eps}
 \caption{A scenario of a real-time cooperative editing session}
 \label{fig:example1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Vector Time}
Most algorithms, including the one we implemented,
use \emph{vector times} to determine the causal ordering relation. Each site
maintains a state vector $v$ that has $n$ components where $n$ is the number of 
participating sites. $S$ is the local site. The $i$-th component of $v$ denoted 
as $v[i]$ represents the number of operations executed from site $i$ at site 
$S$. 

\begin{defn}
  For two time vectors u, v \\
  $u \leq v$ iff $\forall i : u[i] \leq v[i]$ \\
  $u < v$ iff $u \leq v$ and $u \not= v$ \\
  $u \parallel v$ iff $\neg(u < v)$ and $\neg(v < u)$
\end{defn}

Notice that $\leq$ and $<$ are partial orders. The \emph{concurrency relation} 
$\parallel$ is reflexive and symmetric.

The above definition gives us a very simple method to decide whether two events 
$e$ and $e'$ are causally related or not: We take their timestamps (vector 
times) and check whether $C(e) < C(e')$ or $C(e') < C(e)$ where $C(x)$ 
determines the timestamp of $x$. If the test succeeds, the events are causally 
related. Otherwise they are independent.


\subsection{Consistency Model}
A cooperative editing system is said to be consistent if it always maintains the
following properties:

\subsubsection{Convergence} 
When the system is at quiescence (i.e. no messages are
in transit), all copies of the shared document are identical.

\subsubsection{Causality-Preservation} 
For any pair of operations $O_a$ and $O_b$,
if $O_a \rightarrow O_b$ then $O_a$ is executed before $O_b$ at all sites.

\subsubsection{Intention-Preservation} 
For any operation $O$, the effects of
executing $O$ at all sites are the same as the intention of $O$, and the effect
of executing $O$ does not change the effects of independent operations.


\subsection{Operational Transformation}
{Ellis and Gibbs}~\cite{ellis} proposed a new concept for
consistency control, called \emph{Operational Transformation} (OT). 
Algorithms based on OT transform operations to include/exclude the effects of other operations. 
Intuitively, transformation shifts the position parameter of an
operation before execution to include/exclude the effects of previously executed
operations that it was not \emph{aware} of (or that are concurrent) at the
time of its generation. Operational transformation also helps to solve the
problem of intention violation.

An operational transformation algorithm is typically split into two parts. 
First, an application independent consistency control algorithm which determines 
what operations need to be transformed against what other operations. Second,
a set of application dependent transformation functions. There are two
types of transformation functions, inclusion transformation (IT) and 
exclusion transformation (ET). All operational transformation algorithms
use inclusion transformation, whereas exclusion transformation is used
by fewer OT algorithms.

A transformation function has to be defined for every combination of operations.
So for a text editor with the two primitive operations \emph{insert} and
\emph{delete} as defined above, there would be a total of four transformation
functions for IT and another four for ET. That is, given a transformation
function T the following four transformation functions have to be defined:
T(\emph{insert,insert}), T(\emph{insert,delete}), T(\emph{delete,insert}), 
and T(\emph{delete,delete}). This makes it also hard create collaborative
editing applications with a greater set of operations, as the number of
transformation functions increases exponentially.


\subsubsection{Inclusion Transformation}
Inclusion transformation includes the effect of another operation into an
operation. The precondition of IT is that both operations are defined on the
same document state (i.e. have the same vector time). If we have an operation
$O_1 = Ins(0,'a')$, an operation $O_2 = Del(1,1)$ (both defined on the same
document state) and the document state "123", we can either first
execute $O_1$ or $O_2$. If we execute $O_1$ first, we cannot execute $O_2$
as it is. That is where IT comes into play:

$$ IT(O_1,O_2) = O'_2 = Del(2,1) $$

The transformed operation can be applied to the document resulting in the
correct document state "a13". For a more complete definition of exclusion
transformation see the \emph{Report Evaluation Algorithm}.

\subsubsection{Exclusion Transformation}
Exclusion transformation transforms an operation $O_1$ against another operation
$O_2$ in such a way that the impact of $O_2$ is effectively excluded from
$O_1$. As exclusion transformation is not used by the selected algorithm, we
refer the interested reader to the \emph{Report Evaluation Algorithm} for
a more complete definition of exclusion transformation. 


\subsection{Transformation Properties}
Depending on the used operational transformation algorithm, the transformation
functions must satisfy certain properties. The algorithm used by ACE must
only satisfy the so called transformation property 1 (TP1). 

\paragraph{Transformation Property 1:}
The transformation property 1 ensures that the effect of executing $O_1$
followed by the transformed request $O'_2$ is the same as executing
request $O_2$ followed by the transformed request $O'_1$.

\begin{defn}
Transformation Property 1 (TP1):
$ O_1 O'_2 \equiv O_2 O'_1 $
\end{defn}

\paragraph{Transformation Property 2:}
The transformation property 1 is a necessary and sufficient condition to
ensure that the groupware system with two users works correct. The
transformation property 2 is needed for a system with more than two users.
As the algorithm used by ACE uses two-way connections exlusively, the
transformation functions do not have to hold transformation property 2.
For a description of this transformation property check the 
\emph{Report Evaluation Algorithm}.




\section{Selection of Algorithm}
In the semester project we made an extensive evaluation of existing algorithms
(see \emph{Report Evaluation Algorithm}). Based on the following selection
criteria we selected an algorithm for the implementation.


\subsection{Selection Criteria}

\begin{description}
\item[Correctness]
Some algorithms proved to be incorrect in certain
cases. This is of course the most important selection criteria.
\item[Availability of Information]
Some papers did not provide enough
information for an implementation of the described algorithm.
\item[Availability of User Undo]
Users of collaborative applications
expect the same commands as in a single user application. 
\item[Algorithmic Complexity]
Some algorithms are strikingly simple,
others are complex, and some are even too complex to be implemented.
\end{description}


\subsection{Selection of Algorithm}
Only two algorithms satisfied the above criteria: 
\emph{adOPTed}~\cite{ressel96} and \emph{Jupiter}~\cite{jupiter95}. The 
following list shows why we have decided to implement \emph{Jupiter}:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Jupiter} is less complex than \emph{adOPTed}. The implementation of  \emph{adOPTed} contains a higher risk of unforeseen problems. 
 \item More technical issues remained unanswered on the \emph{adOPTed} 
algorithm, e.g. concurrent joining/writing. Therefore, we would have taken a 
higher risk when choosing \emph{adOPTed}.
 \item \emph{Jupiter} is more scalable. The number of 
communication paths in \emph{adOPTed} increases with $n(n-1)$, where $n$ is the 
number of clients. It only rises linearly with the number of clients in 
\emph{Jupiter}.
 \item The client/server model of \emph{Jupiter} better matches the spirit of collaborative editing, i.e. one client announces a document and becomes the server, whereas other clients connect with the server and join the collaborative editing session.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Selection of Transformation Functions}
The \emph{Jupiter} algorithm makes use of a set of transformation functions.
However, no such functions are proposed in the paper. Therefore, we had to 
choose a set of transformation functions which would meet the needs of 
\emph{Jupiter}. The following list identifies the three requirements for the 
transformation functions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item only IT required
 \item TP1 must be satisfied
 \item should be extensible to stringwise transformations
\end{itemize}

These three requirements where only met by one set of transformation
functions. They are described in the paper about \emph{GOTO}~\cite{sun98a}.



\section{Jupiter}
The \emph{Jupiter} system is a collaboration system that supports shared 
documents, shared tools, and, optionally, live audio/video communication. It was 
developed by \emph{Xerox}. It is conceptually a collaborative windowing toolkit. 
The low-level communication facilities make use of operational transformation.

The operational transformation algorithm employed in the \emph{Jupiter} system is derived from \emph{dOPT} (see {Ellis and Gibbs}~\cite{ellis}). A centralized architecture and thus the reduction to point-to-point connections makes the algorithm significantly simpler than other operational transformation algorithms. The basic \emph{Jupiter} algorithm is only suitable for two sites. However, it was shown in \cite{jupiter95} and in greater detail in \cite{netedit:thesis} how to use several point-to-point connections to build a tree-structured $n$-site algorithm (see figure \ref{fig:algorithm.nway}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=7cm,height=4.72cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_nway.eps}
 \caption{multiple 2-way sync to achieve n-way sync}
 \label{fig:algorithm.nway}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Jupiter Algorithm}
As we have seen,
a collaborative editing application requires that local operations are immediately applied to the local document and then sent inside a request to all
the other sites. Additionally to the operation, a request contains the vector
time of the sender. The vector time specifies the state the sender was in
(i.e. how many operations it has processed from itself and the receiver) just
before the new operation was generated.

Because the system does not impose a total ordering on the requests, it is
possible that two or more requests cross in transit. The general tool for 
handling these conflicting (i.e. concurrent) requests is a transformation function, called $xform$ in \cite{jupiter95}.

$$ xform(O_1,O_2)=\{O'_1,O'_2\} $$

This transformation function takes two operations, $O_1$ from the client and 
$O_2$ from the server, and returns two transformed operations $O'_1$ and $O'_2$.
The operations $O'_1$ and $O'_2$ have the property that if the client applies 
$O_1$ followed by $O'_2$, and the server applies $O_2$ followed by $O_1'$, both 
client and server wind up in the same final state (see figure 
\ref{fig:algorithm.basic}). This property is, as we know, the transformation property 1 (TP1):

$$ O_1 O'_2 \equiv O_2 O'_1 $$

Conceptually, the $xform$ function is a combined inclusion transformation (IT) 
that returns $\{IT(O_1,O_2),IT(O_2,O_1)\}$. The parameters $O_1$ and $O_2$ must 
originate from the same document state
(i.e. their timestamps are equal). This is a necessary precondition of 
inclusion transformation. If this precondition is violated, the result of the 
transformation is not guaranteed to be correct.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=6.85cm,height=2.5cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_jupiter1.eps}
 \caption{basic transformation situation in jupiter}
 \label{fig:algorithm.basic}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Point to Point}
It is helpful to show the two dimensional state space that both client and server pass through as they process requests (see figure \ref{fig:algorithm.statespace}). Each state is labelled with the number of processed requests from both client and server to that point. For instance if the client is in the state $(2,3)$, it has generated and processed two requests of its own, and has received and processed three from the server. The client and server requests are displayed on different axis in the state space graph.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=6.63cm,height=4.5cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_statespace.eps}
 \caption{two dimensional state space example}
 \label{fig:algorithm.statespace}
\end{figure}

If there is a conflict, the paths will diverge, as shown in figure 
\ref{fig:algorithm.statespace}. The client and server moved to the state $(1,1)$ 
together by first processing a client request, and then a server request. At 
that point, the client and server processed different requests (concurrently), 
moving to state $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ respectively. They each received and 
processed the other's message using the transformation function to move to state 
$(2,2)$.

As mentioned before, the algorithm labels each request with the state vector the
sender was in just before the message was generated (state vector). The 
recipient uses these state vectors to determine the causality relation.
If the request is not defined from the current state of the 
recipient, there is a conflict (concurrent request). Two concurrent requests 
have to be transformed, but they can only be transformed directly when they were 
generated from the same document state.

Thus, if client and server diverge by more than one step in the state space 
graph, the transformation function cannot be applied directly. Let us consider 
the state space in figure \ref{fig:algorithm.statespace2}. The client has 
executed $c$ and receives the conflicting request $s_1$ from the server. It uses 
the transformation function to compute $s'_1$ to get to the state $(1,1)$. The 
server then generates $s_2$ from the state $(0,1)$, indicating that it still has 
not processed $c$. What should the client do now? It cannot use the 
transformation function directly because $c$ and $s_2$ were not generated from 
the same document state.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=6.71cm,height=4.5cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_statespace2.eps}
 \caption{client and server diverging by more than one path step}
 \label{fig:algorithm.statespace2}
\end{figure}

The solution to this situation is as follows. When the client computes $s'_1$ it 
must also remember $c'$. This represents a hypothetical request that the client 
could have generated to move from the state $(0,1)$ to $(1,1)$. When $s_2$
arrives, the client can use $c'$ to compute $c''$. It executes $s'_2$ to get to 
the state $(1,2)$. If the server has processed the client's message, it will be 
in the state $(1,2)$ as well. If not, its next request will originate from 
$(0,3)$, so the client saves $c''$ just in case.

The algorithm guarantees that if the transformation function satisfies TP1, then 
no matter how far the client and server diverge in the state space, when they do 
reach the same state (and they do, unless requests get lost), they will have 
equivalent states (so convergence is achieved).

\subsubsection{Extending Jupiter to N-Way Communication}
\label{sect:algorithm.jupiter.nway}
We have discussed how a single two-way connection works in \emph{Jupiter}. We will now extend this systems to support $n$ clients using multiple two-way connections. The figure \ref{fig:algorithm.nway-details} shows the basic setup for three clients. Each client talks only to the server over a standard previously discussed two-way connection. These standard two-way connections
are depicted in the figure. For each connection there are two algorithms,
a client-side and a server-side algorithm:
$A_1$ and $A'_1$ for client 1, $A_2$ and $A'_2$ for client 2, and $A_3$ and
$A'_3$ for client 3. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=6.31cm,height=3.56cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_nway-details.eps}
 \caption{Concept of n-way synchronization using a central server}
 \label{fig:algorithm.nway-details}
\end{figure}

Let us say client 1 generates a local operation, for which the algorithm
creates a request. This request is sent to the server-side counterpart $A'_1$ of
this algorithm, which transforms the incoming request against any concurrent
requests (i.e. requests sent from the server that crossed that particular 
request in transit).

$A'_1$ extracts a (potentially) transformed operation from the received 
request. This operation is then given to the other server-side algorithms,
in our example $A'_2$ and $A'_3$. These algorithms create
requests for that operation and send them to $A_2$ and $A_3$ respectively.

\textbf{Note:} If \emph{Jupiter} is used in this setup, it is crucial that
only one request is processed at a time by the server. Processing of
requests from the clients must be serialized. Otherwise the setup cannot
guarantee consistency maintenance, most likely the replicas will diverge.

For an example how this setup works check the 
\emph{Report Implementation Algorithm}. There you find a simple example
of the n-way setup.


\subsection{Undo/Redo}
\label{sect:algorithm.undoredo}
During the summer break we tried to complete the implementation of undo/redo
in our \emph{Jupiter} implementation. However, we have stumbled across
a puzzle we could not solve. In this section, we explain why it was
not possible to adapt the undo/redo algorithm from \emph{adOPTed} to \emph{Jupiter}. Note that the basic operational transformation undo mechansim is explained in \emph{Report Implementation Algorithm}. The reader is referred to that document for a basic understanding of undo/redo. This is essential to understand the following description.

\subsubsection{Order Puzzle 2}
The paper about undo for \emph{adOPTed} (\cite{ressel99}) defined
the so-called order puzzle (example 2). They showed how their proposed
extension for \emph{adOPTed} could solve that puzzle. Now, we define
a new order puzzle that can only occur in the n-way setup of \emph{Jupiter}
when there are more than 2 participants.

Suppose we start with a document state "abc". There are three users A, B and C. Now user A deletes
character a from the document resulting in the document state "bc" at all sites.
Next, user B deletes character b from the document resulting in the document state "c" at all sites and last, the user C deletes character c resulting in the document state "" at all sites. Thus, this leaves the system with an empty document state at all sites.

Now, all three users concurrently undo their last operation. The operation is undone locally without any problems and then sent to the server. The server serializes the processing of requests.
Let us say that first the undo operation from user A is processed at the server, next
the undo from user B and last the undo from user C.

Figure \ref{fig:algorithm.undoredopuzzle} shows the server side
algorithm of user C after processing the undo requests from A and B and just
before processing the undo request from user C.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=5.79cm,height=4.10cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_undopuzzle.eps}
 \caption{Order puzzle with three participants}
 \label{fig:algorithm.undoredopuzzle}
\end{figure}

The insert operation \texttt{Ins(0,c)} which is the undo operation from user C (\texttt{Del(0,c)}) must be transformed from the state
vector \texttt{(2,1)} to the current state vector of the algorithm
\texttt{(4,1)} to get the transformed operation \texttt{Ox} that can
be applied to the current document state. 
Normally, in situations with only 2 users and concurrent undo
requests, we would apply the mirror and fold operators as described
in the \emph{Implementation Report Algorithm} section 2.3.2 successfully to transform the undo operation. However, in the given situation we have two intertwined undo requests. A
situation in which we cannot apply mirror and fold. This can happen only
if there are more than two concurrent undo requests and more than two users, respectively.

The root of the problem stems from the fact that on the server, the
n-way setup of \emph{Jupiter} reduces the dimension of the system from
n (the number of participants) to two for 
each algorithm (as a basic \emph{Jupiter}
algorithm can only handle two sites). However, this reduction results in
an information loss. Namely, we no longer know which requests are from
which participant. This hinders the application of the mirror and fold
operators.

\paragraph{Conclusion}
Due to the insight we gained from the above problem, we came to the following conclusion: Though we cannot formally prove it, we concluded that it is practically infeasible to implement operational transformation undo/redo support for \emph{Jupiter} with more than two users.

\subsubsection{Possible Solution}
The only simple and clean way to solve the problem that we found with our
limited research of the problem is to avoid that reduction altogether and
work with n-dimensions in the state space. The \emph{Jupiter} algorithm
extended to use an n-dimensional state space is the algorithm
known as \emph{adOPTed}.

\subsubsection{Decision}
Short of implementing \emph{adOPTed} we did not see any way to solve
this order puzzle. Implementing \emph{adOPTed} with undo/redo proved to
be poorly documented, so an implementation would be a high risk for the
overall success of the project. Thus, we decided to drop undo/redo support in 
ACE.


\section{Implementation}
The implementation of the algorithm and the related classes can be found
in the package \texttt{ch.\-iserver.\-ace.\-algorithm} and its subpackages
in the folder \texttt{src/java}.

\subsection{Operation}
Operations are used to decribe changes made in a document. They must contain
enough information to reapply the operation at a later time.

In case of simple text editing only two operations are required. An insert 
operation (e.g. \texttt{Ins(1,'hello')}) inserts the string 'hello' at position 
1 and a delete operation (e.g. \texttt{Del(10,5}) deletes 5 characters
starting at offset 10.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=5.74cm,width=11.59cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_operation.eps}
\caption{Operation Hierarchy}
\label{Operation Hierarchy}
\end{figure}

\label{Split_Operation}
As depicted in figure \ref{Operation Hierarchy} there exists a third operation besides the \texttt{InsertOperation} and \texttt{DeleteOperation}. The so-called \texttt{SplitOperation} is a helper object used to encapsulate two operations (usually two delete operations). This special operation is required when transforming an insert operation which occurs in the range of a delete operation. 

For instance if the document state is "abcdefg" and the two operations
\texttt{Ins(3,'X')} and \texttt{Del(1,5)} are to be transformed. If
the delete operation is applied first, this is easy. The index of the insert
operation is then shifted to the beginning of the delete operation. Otherwise,
the delete operation must be split into two operations. Once the insert
operation is applied, we have the document state 'abcXdefg'. The transformed
delete operation must thus be: \texttt{Del(1,2)} and \texttt{Del(4,3)},
which is a split operation. Note that the second delete operation must be
applied first, because otherwise the second operation would have to be
transformed against the first operation to achieve the desired intention.

An additional operation is used when two delete operations are transformed
against each other when the one operations includes the effect of the other
operation. So if we have $O_1 = O_2 = $ \texttt{Del(1,1)} then transforming
$O_2$ to include the effect of $O_1$ we get a no-operation operation, because
the effect of the operation has already been achieved.


\subsection{Request}
A request is used to distribute changes of a document over the network. It 
contains an operation, a timestamp (document 
state on which the operation is based) and the site id of the generating site
(the direction of the state vector in the state space). The convention is
that the server-side algorithm has the site id 0 and the client-side
algorithm has the site id 1. This has the effect that operations
from the server have in some cases a higher priority in the transformation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.87cm,width=12.09cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_request.eps}
\caption{Request Class Diagram}
\label{Request Class Diagram}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm,height=8.78cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm.eps}
\caption{Algorithm Class Diagram}
\label{fig:algorithm.uml}
\end{figure}

The algorithm package centers around the \texttt{Algorithm} interface.
It gives the flexibility to switch the implementation without affecting the 
rest of the system. The currently only implementation of the \texttt{Algorithm} 
interface is the \texttt{Jupiter} class. \texttt{Jupiter} processes 
all requests with the collaboration of an \texttt{InclusionTransformation}
implementation. The only implementation is \texttt{GOTOInclusionTransformation}. (see figure \ref{fig:algorithm.transformation.uml})

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm,height=3.49cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_transformation.eps}
\caption{InclusionTransformation Interface}
\label{fig:algorithm.transformation.uml}
\end{figure}

Each algorithm has a local timestamp, which can be retrieved with the
\texttt{getTimestamp():Timestamp} method. In the 
case of \emph{Jupiter}, the timestamp is a vector time. The vector 
time represents the current location in the 2-dimensional state space of 
\emph{Jupiter}. 

The site id assigned to the algorithm can be retrieved with the
\texttt{getSiteId():int} method. The site id can be important in certain
transformation cases to decide which operation has higher priority, i.e.
is not shifted.

\subsubsection{Outgoing Queue}
\label{sect:algorithm.outgoingqueue}
\emph{Jupiter} stores all outgoing requests in a queue. Whenever a request
is received by the algorithm, the timestamp of the request is checked to
see how many requests the other site has already processed. All the requests
in the outgoing queue that have been processed by the other site are discarded.
The incoming request is then transformed against the remaining 
requests in the queue, which are concurrent to the incoming request. 
The transformed operation is then ready to be applied to the
local document.

The figure \ref{fig:algorithm.outqueue} shows on the left side an outgoing
queue with four operations. Now, suppose a request with timestamp $[0,2]$
is received, indicating that the other site has processed two requests
from the local site. The first two requests in the queue can then be
discarded, leaving us with just two requests. The incoming request is then
transformed against these two (concurrent) requests.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9.31cm,height=2.58cm]{../images/finalreport/algorithm_outqueue.eps}
\caption{Outgoing queue before and after receiving a request}
\label{fig:algorithm.outqueue}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Generating Requests}
Whenever a local operation is generated it has to be sent to the other sites.
These operations must be encapsulated in a request. The
\texttt{+generate\-Request(op:Operation):Request} is used to create a request
for the operation. That request can be sent to the other sites.

\subsubsection{Receiving Requests}
When a request is received, it must be passed to the
\texttt{+receive\-Request(r:Request):Operation} method. This method returns
the potentially transformed operation, which is to be applied to the
local document.

\subsubsection{Undo/Redo}
The \texttt{Algorithm} interface also has methods to support undo and redo.
The corresponding methods are 
\texttt{+undo():Request}, \texttt{+redo():Request},
\texttt{+canUndo():boolean}, and \texttt{+canRedo():boolean}. 
Unfortunately
\emph{Jupiter} does not support these operations. For more information why
\emph{Jupiter} does not support undo/redo read \ref{sect:algorithm.undoredo}.

\subsubsection{Index Transformations}
Beside the transformation of operations against other operations, the
\texttt{Algorithm} also supports transformation of an index against an
operation.

The \texttt{transformIndices(t:Timestamp,indices:int[]):int[]} method transforms
an array of integers against all concurrent operations. The indices itself
do not modify the operations inside the outgoing queue in the transformation.

\textbf{Note:} This is a feature added during the diploma project to support
the transformation of awareness information.

\subsubsection{Acknowledge}
A potential problem arises if one site is idle while the other is generating
requests. In that case, the outgoing queue of the site that generates requests
grows indefinitely, because no acknowledge messages are ever received and thus
no requests in the outgoing queue can be discarded.

Thus we extended the standard \emph{Jupiter} algorithm to support acknowledge
messages. An acknowledge message is simply the local timestamp and the site
id. An acknowledge message is passed to the algorithm with the
\texttt{+acknowledge(siteId:int,t:Timestamp)} method.

\textbf{Note:} This is a feature added during the diploma project to
avoid the problem described above.




\subsection{Transformation Functions}
The GOTO (generic operation transformation optimized) transformation functions 
are designed to work with strings as well as characters. The advantage is that 
less transformations have to be done when a string is inserted into a text. 

The transformation function has to be defined for all possible combinations
of operations. In the case of insert and delete operations, there are four
transformation functions to be defined.

In the following pseudo code of the transformation function, the following
functions are used:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{p(x)} denotes the position of operation $x$
 \item \texttt{o(x)} denotes the original (untransformed) position of operation $x$
 \item \texttt{id(x)} denotes the site id of the site that generated the operation $x$
 \item \texttt{len(x)} denotes the length of the operation $x$
 \item \texttt{text(x)} denotes the text deleted or inserted by operation $x$
 \item \texttt{ins(p,txt,o)} creates a construction of a insert operation with index $p$, text $txt$, and origin position $o$
 \item \texttt{del(p,txt)} creates a delete operation with index $p$ and text $txt$
 \item \texttt{split(x,y)} creates a new split operation whose first operation is $x$ and whose second operation is $y$
 \item \texttt{clone(x)} clones operation $x$
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Origin Position}
The origin position is the original position of an operation. It is set by
the creator of the operation and then never modified although the operation
itself (and therfore its position) are transformed. The origin position 
helps to ensure that the user's intention are not violated in some rare
cases. (see \emph{Report Implementation Algorithm} section 2.4.2 for 
examples where the use of the original position is an improvement)


\subsubsection{Insert/Insert}

\small{\begin{verbatim}
  def transform(a,b)
    if p(a) < p(b) 
        or p(a) == p(b) and o(a) < o(b) 
        or p(a) == p(b) and o(a) == o(b) and id(a) < id(b)
      return clone(a)
    else
      return ins(p(a) + len(b), text(a), o(a))
    end
  end
\end{verbatim}}

\begin{description}
 \item[Case 1] If either of the following conditions is true, the operation $a$ is returned unmodified.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Operation $a$ starts before operation $b$.
  \item Operation $a$ starts at the same index as operation $b$ and the origin position of $a$ is before the origin position of $b$.
  \item Operation $a$ starts at the same index as operation $b$ and the origin positions of $a$ and $b$ are equal and the site id of $a$ is lower than the site id of $b$.
 \end{itemize}
 \item[Case 2] Operation $a$ starts inside or after operation $b$. The index of the transformed operation $a$ must be increased by the length of the text of operation $b$.

 \item[Case 9] Operation $a$ is completely before operation $b$. Nothing has to be transformed. 
 \item[Case 10] Operation $a$ starts at the end or after operation $b$. The index of the transformed operation $a$ must be reduced by the length of the text of operation $b$.
 \item[Case 11] Operation $a$ and operation $b$ are overlapping. Operation $b$ starts before or at the same position as operation $a$ and ends after or at the same position as operation $a$. The content of operation $a$ has already been deleted by operation $b$. Therefore, nothing has to be deleted by the transformed operation $a$ (a so called noop (no-operation) is returned).
 \item[Case 12] Operation $a$ and operation $b$ are overlapping. Operation $b$ starts before or at the same position as operation $a$ and ends before operation $b$. The overlapping part of the two operations has been deleted by operation $b$. The transformed operation $a$ has to delete only the remaining text (the text after the overlapping text of the two operations).
 \item[Case 13] Operation $a$ and operation $b$ are overlapping. Operation $b$ starts after operation $a$ and ends after or at the same position as operation $a$. The overlapping part of the two operations has been deleted by operation $b$. The transformed operation $a$ has to delete the remaining text (text before the overlapping text of the two operations).
 \item[Case 14] Operation $a$ and operation $b$ are overlapping. Operation $b$ is fully inside operation $a$. The overlapping part of the two operations has been deleted by operation $b$. The transformed operation $a$ has to delete the remaining text (text before and after the overlapping text of the two operations).
