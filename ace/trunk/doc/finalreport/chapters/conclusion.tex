All in all, this project was a great experience to all of us. We have learned a lot by the interesting subject and got to know multiple state-of-the-art frameworks. We have learned to work in a team of three developers and how important it is to partition the work clearly. This project will be a good personal reference for the future.

We believe in the potential of our work and are motivated to continue developing it. Last but not least, the diploma work could have only been the start to a new open source project with great potential and many years to come...to be continued.
