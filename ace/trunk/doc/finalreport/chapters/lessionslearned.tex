First of all, it was a great time with a really cool and efficient team. I have got to know new frameworks like \textit{GlazedLists} and \textit{Springframework} which are very usefull for GUI programming. \\

Writing all documents in english was good a practise to improve my english skills which are a bit more fluent now. \\

Too bad, we didnt had the double amount of time so that we were able to realize more features to make ACE to a more pwoerfull tool.
