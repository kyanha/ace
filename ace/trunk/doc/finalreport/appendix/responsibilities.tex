\chapter{Responsibilities}
\label{chapter:responsibilities}

In this appendix we list which team member is responsible for a certain part
of the source code and who is responsible for parts of the documentation.



\section{Documentation}
The following table shows the responsible team member for each of the
five documents:

\section{Source Code}
The architecture of ACE consists of three distinct layer. The 
API between the layers has been defined by \emph{Simon Raess} with some 
minor changes during the project. Every layer
was assigned to one team member, who was responsible to design and implement
the layer implementation. In some rare cases one of use helped another
person implement a minor part of his layer. The assignment is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Application Layer: \emph{Mark Bigler}
 \item Collaboration Layer: \emph{Simon Raess}
 \item Network Layer: \emph{Lukas Zbinden}
\end{itemize}

The package \texttt{ch.iserver.ace.algorithm} was mainly implemented during
the semester project. Additions needed to support the transformation of
awareness information and acknowledge messages were added by \emph{Simon Raess}.

Thread domains have been designed and implemented by \emph{Simon Raess}.
