\chapter*{abstract}

Working on a document as a group can be challenging. Version control systems like Subversion and CVS help to keep a consistent copy of a document, but they do not allow real-time collaboration. Would it not be easier and more efficient to edit a document together in real-time, seeing each other’s changes immediately and reducing the amount of time to complete work substantially? The error prone step of merging several asynchronous changes to a document can be avoided altogether with a real-time synchronous collaborative editor, namely ACE - a collaborative editor.

ACE is a platfrom-indepentdent, collaborative text editor. It allows multiple geographically dispersed users to view and edit a shared text document at the same time, thus facilitating efficient teamwork. Though the idea of editing together a document at the same time is not widely considered, it has great potential and many application areas. Shared document editing could be important for organizations that are global in nature and have geographically distributed  teams. The application areas provided by the collaborative functionality of ACE are not limited by the system itself but rather by our minds and creativity, respectively. ACE therefore shall open up new ways of teamwork and enable real-time collaboration supported by computers.
