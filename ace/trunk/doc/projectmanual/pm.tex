\section{Project Organization}

In the diploma project we use a lifecycle model tailored to our needs. It is an iterative
model with a very short iteration time (2 weeks). Three iterations are planned where the last
iteration consists mainly of bugfixes and/or usability improvements. Each phase is
completed by a milestone (see the milestone plan \ref{sect:Milestone Plan}). At the end of
the third phase, the application will be finished according to the defined goals (see
\emph{System Requirements} document).

At the beginning we invest some time to initialize the project and to create a concept
for the implementation. The concept includes the design of the interfaces between the
three layers into which ACE is split: application, collaboration, and network layer.

In the first iteration, we start implementing the different layers. Each layer is
implemented by a different team member for which he is responsible. If one team member
finishes a layer earlier, he helps another team member. The following table shows
who is responsible for which layer. The layer lead developer is responsible that his
layer is completed in time and fully functioning. However this does not mean that
a layer is implemented 100 percent by one person.

   Network Layer             & Lukas Zbinden \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Layers and Lead Developers}

\end{table}

\subsection{Layers}

ACE is split into three independent layers. Each layer has a well-defined interface
between the adjoining layers and well-defined responsibilities. 
It should be possible to replace a layer implementation without affecting the other 
layers.

 \caption{The Layers of ACE}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Application Layer:} The application layer consists mainly in the graphical
user interface. ACE itself will have a layer implementation based on a Java Swing GUI.

\paragraph{Collaboration Layer:} The collaboration layer provides the collaborative
editing functionality to the application layer. It hosts the core consistency
control algorithm, which is based on the concept of operational transformation.
By replacing the collaboration layer it would be theoretically possible to replace
the employed consistency control algorithm. Further it uses the network layer
for all network related functionality.

\paragraph{Network Layer:} The network layer is the lowest layer of ACE. It provides
networking functionality to the collaboration layer. The two most important features
are discovery of users and documents as well as communication with other users and
sessions. Replacing the network layer allows to use a different network technology 
and/or a different protocol.

\subsection{Milestone Plan}
\label{sect:Milestone Plan}

In the diploma project there are three milestones. Each milestone is at the end of an iteration.

\subsubsection{Milestone M1}

The scheduled release date of Milestone 1 is: 21.11.2005. Milestone 1 includes the text editor with
all the discovery related functionality. Although it will be possible to publish local documents
it is not yet possible to join the shared documents.

\begin{itemize}
 \item create new documents
 \item load and save documents
 \item open multiple documents at the same time
 \item cut/copy/paste
 \item about information
 \item publish local documents
 \item automatic discovery of other running instances of ACE on a local area network (user discovery)
 \item automatic discovery of published documents of other running instances of ACE (document discovery)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Milestone M2}

The scheduled release date of Milestone 2 is: 05.12.2005. Milestone 2 adds the collaboration functionality
to the text editor, including joining documents, collaborative editing, and awareness information.

\begin{itemize}
 \item join published documents
 \item collaborative editing in a shared document
 \item awareness information
 \item leave joined documents
 \item kick users
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Milestone M3}

The scheduled release date of Milestone 3 is: 12.12.2005. Milestone 3 incorporates mainly bugfixes and
usability improvements based on feedback from testing.

\begin{itemize}
 \item bug fixes
 \item usability improvements
 \item design
 \item optional goals
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods and Tools}

\subsection{Documentation}
To create the documentation, \LaTeX{} shall be used. Naturally, other applications are used for creating images and diagrams.
Because \LaTeX{} is a text-based format we can use SubEthaEdit (a collaborative editor for Mac OS X) and later even
ACE itself to collaboratively edit the documentation. 

\subsection{Source Repository}
Subversion is used as revision control system. The URL for Subversion access is
\href{http://ace.iserver.ch:81/repos/ace/ace}{http://ace.iserver.ch:81/repos/ace/ace}. The HEAD of the repository can
be browsed with a standard web browser.

\subsection{Website}
The project website's URL is \href{http://ace.iserver.ch}{http://ace.iserver.ch}. It is used mainly as a marketing instrument
for potential users. 

\subsection{Wiki}
We use the Confluence Wiki from http://www.atlassian.com/. It is available
at http://ace.iserver.ch:8080/confluence/. The Wiki is mainly used internally.

\subsection{Issue Tracker}
We use Jira from http://www.atlassian.com as issue tracker. It is available
at http://ace.iserver.ch:8080/jira/. The Issue Tracker is mainly used internally.

\subsection{Continous Integration}
We have a continous integration server (http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) that builds the
sources regularly and runs all the unit tests.

\subsection{Development}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Java 1.4.2
 \item Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/)
 \item SubEthaEdit (http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/)
 \item Ant 1.6.x (http://ant.apache.org/)
 \item Maven 2.0 Ant Tasks 2.0-beta-3 (http://maven.apache.org/)
 \item CruiseControl (http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/)
\end{itemize}


\section{Standards and Guidelines}

\subsection{Documentation}
All \LaTeX{} documents must include the file \texttt{ace.tex}. This file can be found in the subversion repository at \texttt{/ace/trunk/doc/latex/ace.tex}.
A template for all \LaTeX{} documents is in the same directory (\texttt{template.tex}). There is also a template for titlepages (\texttt{template.tex}).

\subsection{Source Code}
The documentation of the source code is done with JavaDoc. The comments must be written in English. Source code files must have the following standard header,
which can be found at \texttt{/ace/trunk/doc/templates/source.header} in the Subversion repository.
