\section{Introduction}

ACE is a collaborative editor. Collaborative editing allows multiple users
to edit a shared document together on different computers. Changes of each 
user can be viewed by the other users immediately.


\section{Project Goals}

The goal of the project ACE is to create a collaborative text editor. In 
the following a more detailed description of the functionality is described.
The project goals are categorized into mandatory, optional, and non-goals.

\subsection{Mandatory Goals}

The following list shows the basic features of the text editor:

\begin{itemize}
 \item create new documents
 \item load and save documents
 \item open multiple documents at the same time
 \item cut/copy/paste
 \item about information
\end{itemize}

And this is the list of collaboration functionality that must be implemented:

\begin{itemize}
 \item publish local documents
 \item automatic discovery of other running instances of ACE on a local area network
 \item automatic discovery of published documents of other running instances of ACE
 \item join published documents
 \item collaborative editing in a shared document
 \item awareness information
 \item conceal published documents
 \item leave joined documents
 \item kick users
\end{itemize}

One of the core principles for ACE was that we wanted it to be as simple as possible to set up. Most users
will feel lost if they have to enter IP addresses and ports. So ACE has to support automatic discovery
of other users (other running instances of ACE) and their shared documents. These automatically discovered
users and documents must be displayed in the graphical user interface where the user has a set of actions
to interact with them.

Discovered shared documents of other users can be joined. Already joined document editing sessions can
be left and the publisher can kick participants in an editing session that are not welcome. A
publisher of a document can conceal a document, which effectively ends the collaborative editing
session. When a shared
document is joined, it is possible to collaboratively edit the same shared document at the same time. 
So-called awareness information provides information about the other users editing location, i.e. their
current text insert position and selection.


\subsection{Optional Goals}

We might implement optional goals if we have additional time.

\begin{itemize}
 \item access right mechanism
 \item manual discovery of running instances outside of the local area network
 \item invite other users to a session 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Access Right Mechanism}

There is no mandatory goal that requires any kind of access right mechanism 
meaning that any user can join a published document and gain read/write 
access. Of course, this can be an undesirable situation, especially in an 
environement where you do not trust all the other users on the local 
area network.

An access right mechanism should allow the publisher to choose default access 
rights for each of his published documents. These default access rights 
specify which access rights a freshly joined user gets. Reasonable access 
modes would be:

\begin{itemize}
 \item ask for join permission
 \item read-only access
 \item read-write access
\end{itemize}

The first access mode ensures that nobody can access or even view a shared 
document before the publisher explicitely grants that user more the permission
(i.e. read-only or read-write). The access rights can be changed for each 
user independently or globally for all participants in a shared document.

\subsubsection{Manual Discovery}

Beside the automatic discovery, a mechanism to explicitely discover other users
might be implemented. This mechanism allows to enter IP/port information to
connect to another ACE instance running on another network.

\subsubsection{Invitations}
The publisher of a shared document should be able to invite other users to an 
editing session of a particular shared document.

\subsection{Non-Goals}

Due to the limited available time, certain (useful) functionality cannot be 
implemented in the diploma project. The principle is that if something is not
explicitely listed in the project goals, it is not a goal of the project. 
However, we want to explicitely highlight in this section some points that are 
not goals.

\begin{itemize}
 \item security aspects: authentication, confidentiality
 \item undo/redo
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security Aspects}
Collaborative editing requires that changes to the local replica of the shared 
document must be sent to the other participants. These changes pass through
the network and thus can be viewed by eavesdroppers. As the document might 
contain potentially confidential information, ideally all transformation 
should be encrypted.

Further, if a user tries to join a document, the publisher should be certain 
who the joining user is. The use of digital signatures would help to 
ascertain the identity of the joining user.

Although both authentication and confidentiality would be very useful additions
to a collaborative editor, they will not be implemented in ACE for time 
reasons.

\subsubsection{Undo/Redo}
In the semester project we envisioned ACE to have a fully functioning 
undo/redo, even in a collaborative editing session. Unfortunately we have 
stumbled across a bug, which we could not resolve in reasonable time. That is 
the reason why ACE will not have any undo/redo actions. We will explain the 
source of the problem in detail in the final report. 


\section{Requirements}

In this section, the basic requirements for ACE are described.

\paragraph{Platform Independence}
The currently only working collaborative text editor is limited to the Mac
platform. ACE must run on at least Windows, Linux, and Mac platform.

\paragraph{Programming Language}
ACE has to be implemented with Java SE 1.4.2. This requirement comes directly
from the platform independece requirement.

\paragraph{Interoperability}
The protocol employed by ACE should be open and platform independent. 
For that reason, we won't use Java serialization in the network layer.

\paragraph{Configuration}
As ACE is an end-user application, the required configuration for the 
application should be minimal, ideally zero.

\paragraph{No Server Application}
ACE is an end-user application. We do not want that it is necessary to setup
an additional server application in order to use ACE. All that should be
necessary to start using ACE is to download the application and start it.


\section{Architecture}

ACE uses a concurrency control algorithm that is based on a client-server 
architecture. The document content is replicated at each participant's
site. In order to maintain the consistency of the replicas, each operation 
has to pass through the server algorithm. We consider this as a natural
fit, because of the nature of collaborative editing. A user shares a 
local document and other users can join the editing session. However, setting
up a separate server is not desired because this would require additional 
setup steps.

In ACE, each running instance of the application will start one network level
server. This server publishes the presence of the application on the local
area network. It runs inside the client application. There is no specialized 
server application.

For each published document an additional logical server exists for the 
transformation and forwarding of messages. This logical server is not an 
additional network server.

The figure \ref{fig:collaboration} shows a network with three applications. 
User C shares document 1 and user A shares documents 2 and 3. Each user
in this situation is part of the documents 1, 2, and 3, either as publisher
or as participant.
