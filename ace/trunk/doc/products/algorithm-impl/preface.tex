\chapter*{Preface}
This document describes the most central part of any collaborative application: the concurrency control algorithm.

This document is split into the following chapters:

\paragraph{Chapter 1: Decisions} Describes why we chose the \emph{Jupiter} algorithm as base for our implementation of a concurrency control algorithm. Further it reasons about the choice of transformation functions.

\paragraph{Chapter 2: Concepts} Explains how the concurrency control algorithm works. It contains many examples that show possible issues that must be resolved by the algorithm.

\paragraph{Chapter 3: Implementation} Shows how the concepts from chapter 2 were implemented.

\section*{Prerequisities}
In order to understand this report, the reader should at least be familiar with the introduction of 'Report Evaluation Algorithm'. It is also recommended to read the appendix A: 'Undo in multiuser collaborative applications'.
