\subsection{CCU}
\label{algo:ccu}

CCU (a Calculus for Concurrent Update) derives from the \emph{dOPT} (see \ref{algo:dopt}) algorithm. It was developped by Gordon V.Cormack in 1995 that discovered earlier \cite{cormack95a} that \emph{dOPT} is incorrect. 

The algorithm specifies a concurrent model based on a sequential model augmented with definitions of all possible pairs of elementary operations (updates). The concurrent model is implemented by a set of objects: one for each source of events.

Although there is a description of the algorithm in \cite{cormack95b}, many implementation details are left out. The only information is given is that the simplest n-site algorithm is a star built from multiple versions of the 2-site implementation.

Interestingly no references to this algorithm are found in the research material from other researchers. 

\subsubsection{Properties}
\begin{itemize}
 \item correctness never confirmed by other reaserchers
 \item uses state vectors to maintain causal ordering
 \item architecture: semi-replicated (central server)
\end{itemize}
