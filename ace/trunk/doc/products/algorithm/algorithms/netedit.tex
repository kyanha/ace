\subsection{NetEdit Consistency Algorithm}
\label{algo:netedit}

\emph{NetEdit} is a collaborative text editor (\cite{netedit}) that uses a replicated architecture with processing and data distributed across all clients. It uses an $n$-way synchronization protocol derived from the algorithm of the \emph{Jupiter} (see \ref{algo:jupiter}) collaboration system. The algorithm is called \emph{NetEdit Consistency Algorithm}.

The 2-way synchronization protocol developed for \emph{Jupiter} was the starting point. That algorithm was extended to a multi-way protocol using multiple 2-way connections. In \cite{netedit:thesis}, the multi-way protocol that was already mentioned in \cite{jupiter95} is described in detail.

\subsubsection{Properties}
\begin{itemize}
 \item architecture: semi-replicated (central server)
 \item seems to be correct
 \item uses state vectors to decide causality relations
 \item uses multiple 2-way synchronization protocols to create a n-way protocol
 \item free of TP2
\end{itemize}
