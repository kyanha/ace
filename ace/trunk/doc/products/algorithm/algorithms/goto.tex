\subsection{GOTO}
\label{algo:goto}

The \emph{GOT} (see \ref{algo:got}) control algorithm integrated with the undo/do/redo scheme achieves both intention-preservation and convergence. Sun et. al \cite{sun98b} modified the \emph{GOT} control algorithm in such a way that the IT/ET functions must satisfy TP1 and TP2. The resulting algorithm is called \emph{GOTO} (GOT optimized).

The original \emph{GOT} algorithm, given IT/ET functions that satisfy TP1 and TP2, can ensure both intention preservation and convergence without integrating with the undo/do/redo scheme or using a multi-dimensional graph. This results in a simplified control algorithm that uses fewer IT/ET transformations compared to \emph{GOT}.


\subsubsection{Properties}
\begin{itemize}
 \item uses state vectors to determine causality relations
 \item uses inclusion transformation (IT) and exclusion transformation (ET)
 \item architecture: replicated (no central server needed)
 \item TP1 and TP2 must be ensured by IT/ET functions
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Implementations}
The \emph{GOTO} control algorithm was implemented in the \emph{REDUCE} prototype.
