\section{Introduction}
Real-time cooperative editing systems allow multiple users to view and edit the same document at the same time from multiple sites connected by communication networks. Consistency maintenance is one of the most significant challenges in designing and implementing real-time cooperative editing systems. 


\subsection{Requirements}
The following requirements have been identified for such systems.

\paragraph{Real-time:} The response to local user actions must be quick, ideally as quick as a single-user editor, and the latency for reflecting remote user actions is low (determined by external communication latency only). 

\paragraph{Distributed:} Cooperating users may reside on different machines connected by communication networks with nondeterministic latency.

\paragraph{Unconstrained:} Multiple users are allowed to concurrently and independently edit any part of the document at any time, in order to facilitate free and natural information flow among multiple users.


\subsection{Preliminaries}
In this section, some basic concepts and terminologies are introduced. Following Lamport\cite{lamport78}, we define a causal (partial) ordering relation on operations in terms of their generation and execution sequences as follows.

\begin{defn}
Causal ordering relation $\rightarrow$
\end{defn}

Given two operations $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$ generated at sites $i$ and $j$, then $O_{a}\rightarrow O_{b}$, iff:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $i=j$ and the generation of $O_{a}$ happened before the generation of 
       $O_{b}$
 \item or $i \neq $j and the execution of $O_{a}$ at site $j$ happened before 
       the generation of $O_{b}$
 \item or there exists an operation $O_{x}$ such that $O_{a}\rightarrow O_{x}$
       and $O_{x}\rightarrow O_{b}$
\end{enumerate}

Note that the causal ordering relation is a \emph{partial ordering}.

\begin{defn}
Dependent and independent operations
\end{defn}

Given any two operations $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $O_{b}$ is \emph{dependent} on $O_{a}$ iff $O_{a} \rightarrow O_{b}$
 \item $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$ are \emph{independent} (or \emph{concurrent}), 
       expressed as $O_{a} \Arrowvert O_{b}$ iff neither 
       $O_{a}\rightarrow O_{b}$ nor $O_{b}\rightarrow O_{a}$
\end{enumerate}

Intuitively we can say that two operations are dependant if there exists a path from the generation of one message to the generation of another message. So for example in figure \ref{fig:example1} operation $O_{1}$ and $O_{3}$ are dependent, that is $O_{1}\rightarrow O_{3}$. Operation $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are \emph{independent}. 


\subsection{A shared document model}
Consider $n$ sites, where each site has a copy of the shared document. The shared document model we take is a \emph{text document} modeled a by sequence of characters, indexed from 0 up to the number of characters in the document. It is assumed that the document state (the text) can only be modified by executing the following two primitive editing operations: (i) $Insert(p,c)$ which inserts the character $c$ at position $p$; (ii) $Delete(p)$ which deletes the character at position $p$.

It is important to note that the above text document model is only an abstract view of many document models based on a linear structure. For instance the character parameter may be regarded as a string of charcters, a line, a block of lines, an ordered XML node, etc.


\subsection{Three inconsistency problems}
\label{constraints}

To illustrate the challenges researchers are facing, consider a scenario in a cooperative editing system with three cooperating sites, as shown in figure \ref{fig:example1}. Suppose that an operation is executed on the local replica of the shared document immediately after its generation, then broadcast to remote sites and executed there in its \emph{original form} upon its arrival.
Three different inconsistency problems have been identified by {Sun et. al}\cite{sun98a}.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=2.5in,height=2.88in]{../../images/example1.eps}
 \caption{A scenarion of a real-time cooperative editing session}
 \label{fig:example1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Divergence:}
Operations may arrive and be executed at different sites in different orders, resulting in different final results. As shown in figure \ref{fig:example1}, the four operations in this scenario are executed in the following orders: $O_{1}$, $O_{2}$, $O_{4}$ and $O_{3}$ at site 0; $O_{2}$, $O_{1}$, $O_{3}$ and $O_{4}$ at site 1; and $O_{2}$, $O_{4}$, $O_{3}$ and $O_{1}$ at site 2. Unless operations are commutative, which is generally not the case, final editing results will diverge. The divergence problem can be solved by any serialization protocol, which ensures the final result is the same as if all operations were executed in the same total order at all sites.

\paragraph{Causality violation:}
Due to the nondeterministic communication latency, operations may arrive and be executed out of their natural cause-effect order. As shown in figure \ref{fig:example1}, operation $O_{3}$ is generated after the arrival of $O_{1}$ at site 1, the editing effect of $O_{1}$ on the shared document has been seen by the user 1 at the time $O_{3}$ is generated. Therefore, $O_{3}$ may be \emph{dependent} on $O_{1}$. However, since $O_{3}$ arrives and is executed before $O_{1}$ at site 2, confusion may occure to the system as well as to the user at site 2. For example, if $O_{1}$ is to insert a string into a shared document, and $O_{3}$ is to delete some characters in the string inserted by $O_{1}$, then the execution of $O_{3}$ before $O_{1}$ at site 2 will result in $O_{3}$ referring to a nonexistent context. 

\paragraph{Intention violation:}
Due to concurrent generation of operations, the \emph{actual effect} of an operation at the time of its execution may be different from the \emph{intended effect} of this operation at the time of its generation. As shown in figure \ref{fig:example1}, operation $O_{1}$ is generated at site 0 without any knowledge of $O_{2}$ generated at site 1, so $O_{1}$ is \emph{independent} of $O_{2}$, and vice versa. At site 0, $O_{2}$ is executed on a document state which has been changed by the preceding execution of $O_{1}$. Therefore, the subsequent execution of $O_{2}$ may refer to an incorrect position in the new document state, resulting in an editing effect which is different from the \emph{intention} of $O_{2}$. 

For example, assume the shared document initially contains the following sequence of characters: '"ABCDE'". Suppose $O_{1}=Insert['"12'",1]$, which intends to insert string '"12'" at position 1, i.e. between '"A'" and '"BCDE'"; and $O_{2}=Delete[2,2]$, which intends to delete the two characters starting from position 2, i.e. '"CD'". After the execution of these two operations, the \emph{intention-preserved} result (at all sites) should be: '"A12BE'". However, the actual result at site 0, obtained by executing $O_{1}$ followed by executing $O_{2}$, would be: '"A1CDE'", which apparently violates the intention of $O_{1}$ since the character '"2'", which was intented to be inserted, is missing in the final text, and violates the intention of $O_{2}$ since characters '"CD'", which were intended to be deleted, are still present in the final text.

Even if a serialization-based protocol was used to ensure that all sites execute $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ in the same order to get an identical result '"A1CDE'", but this identical result is still inconsistent with the intentions of both $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$.

\paragraph{} 
The three inconsistency problems are independent in the sense that the occurence of one or two of them does not always result in the others. Particularly, intention violation is an incosistency problem of a different nature from the divergence problem. The essential difference between divergence and intention violation is that the former can always be resolved by a serialization protocol, but the latter cannot be fixed by any serialization protocol if operations were always executed in their originial forms.


\subsection{A consistency model}
A cooperative editing system is said to be consistent if it always maintains the following properties:
\paragraph{Convergence:} when the same set of operations have been executed at all sites, all copies of the shared document are identical.
\paragraph{Causality-preservation:} for any pair of operations $O_a$ and $O_b$, if $O_a \rightarrow O_b$, then $O_a$ is executed before $O_b$ at all sites.
\paragraph{Intention-preservation:} for any operation $O$, the effects of executing $O$ at all sites are the same as the intention of $O$, and the effect of executing $O$ does not change the effects of indepentent operations.

{\setlength{\parskip}{18pt}
In essence, the \emph{convergence} property ensures the consistency of the final results \emph{at the end} of a cooperative editing session; the \emph{causality-preservation} property ensures the consistency of the execution orders of dependent operations \emph{during} a cooperative editing session; and the \emph{intention-preservation} property ensures that executing an opertion at remote sites achieves the same effect as executing this operation at the local site at the time of its generation, and the execution effects of independent operations do not interfere with each other.
}

The consistency model imposes an execution order constraint on dependent operations only. The execution order of independent operations is left open as long as the convergence and intention-preservation properties are maintained. The consistency model effectively specifies, what assurance a cooperative editing system gives to its users and, what properties the underlying consistency maintenance mechanism must support.



\subsection{Operational Transformation}
{Ellis and Gibbs}~\cite{ellis} proposed a new kind of algorithm for consistency control, called \emph{Operational Transformation} (OT).  This kind of algorithm transforms operations to include/exclude the effects of other operations. Intuitively, transformation shifts the position parameter of an operation before execution to incorporate the effects of previously executed operations that it was not "aware" of (or that are concurrent) at the time of generation. Operational transformation helps to solve the problem of intention violation.

In general there are two different types of operational transformation, inclusion transformation (IT) and exclusion transformation (ET). All OT algorithms use inclusion transformation, whereas exclusion transformation is not needed by some algorithms.

A transformation function has to be defined for every combination of operations. So for a text editor with the primitive operations \emph{insert} and \emph{delete}, there would be a total of four transformation functions for IT and another four for ET. That is, given a transformation function T, T(\emph{insert, insert}), T(\emph{insert, delete}), T(\emph{delete, insert}) and T(\emph{delete, delete}) must be defined.

\subsubsection{Definitions}
\label{definitions}
Conceptually, an operation $O$ is associated with a \emph{context}, denoted as $CT_{O}$, which is the list of operations that need to be executed to bring the document from its initial state to the state on which $O$ is defined (\emph{definition context}). The significance of context is that the effect of an operation can be correctly interpreted only in its own context. If the current context (called \emph{execution context}) is different from the definition context of an operation, the operation has to be transformed so that it can be executed in the current context.

\begin{defn}
Context equivalent relation $\sqcup$
\end{defn}

Given two operations $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$, associated with contexts $CT_{O_{1}}$ and $CT_{O_{2}}$ respectively, $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are \emph{context-equivalent} iff $CT_{O_{1}}=CT_{O_{2}}$. Apparently, the context equivalent relation $\sqcup$ is transitive.

\begin{defn}
Context preceding relation $\mapsto$
\end{defn}
Given two operations $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ associated with contexts $CT_{O_{1}}$ and $CT_{O_{2}}$ respectively, $O_{1}$ is \emph{context preceding} $O_{2}$ iff $CT_{O_{2}}=CT_{O_{1}} + [O_{1}]$. Note that the contex preceding relation $\mapsto$ is not transitive by definition.

\subsubsection{Inclusion Transformation}
Inclusion Transformation (IT) transforms an operation $O_{1}$ against another operation $O_{2}$ in such a way that the impact of $O_{2}$ is effectively included. 
\begin{spec}
$IT(O_a,O_b):O'_a$
\end{spec}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Precondition for input parameters: $O_a \sqcup O_b$
 \item Postcondition for output: $O_b \mapsto O'_a$ where $O'_a$'s execution effect in the context of $CT_{O'_a}$ is the same as $O_a$'s execution effect in the context of $CT_{O_a}$.
\end{enumerate}

Most important, it was recognized that the correctness of IT relies on the condition that both $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are defined on the same document state so that their parameters are comparable and can be used to derive a proper adjustment to $O_{2}$, i.e. $O_{1} \sqcup O_{2}$.

\subsubsection{Exclusion Transformation}
Exlusion Transformation (ET) transforms an operation $O_{1}$ against another operation $O_{2}$ in such a way that the impact of $O_{2}$ is effectively excluded from $O_{1}$.
\begin{spec}
$ET(O_a,O_b):O'_a$
\end{spec}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Precondition for input parameters: $O_b \mapsto O_a$
 \item Postcondition for output: $O_b \sqcup O'_a$ where $O'_a$'s execution effect in the context of $CT_{O'_a}$ is the same as $O_a$'s execution effect in the context of $CT_{O_a}$.
\end{enumerate}

Both transformation functions must meet the \emph{reversibility} requirement as defined next.

\subsubsection{Reversibility}
\begin{defn}
Reversibility Requirement
\end{defn}

Given two operations $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item if $O_{1} \sqcup O_{2}$ and $O'_{1} = IT(O_{1},O_{2})$, then it must
       be that $O_{1} = ET(O'_{1},O_{2})$
 \item if $O_{2} \mapsto O_{1}$ and $O'_{1} = ET(O_{1},O_{2})$, then it must
       be that $O_{1} = IT(O'_{1},O_{2})$
\end{enumerate}

Achieving reversibility is not a trivial task. This is because IT/ET functions may loose some information, so reversing the effect of a transformation may not be possible.


\subsection{Transformation Properties}
It was shown in \cite{ressel96} that transformation functions must satisfy two conditions, called $TP1$ and $TP2$. These transformation properties are sufficient and necessary for OT algorithms to guarantee convergence along arbitrary transformation paths.

\paragraph{Transformation Property 1:}
The transformation property 1 ensures that the effect of executing $O_{1}$ followed by the transformed request $O_{2}$ is the same as executing request $O_{2}$ followed by the transformed request $O_{1}$. 

\begin{defn}
Transformation Property 1:
$ O_{1} O'_{2} \equiv O_{2} O'_{1} $
\end{defn}

\paragraph{Transformation Property 2:}
Transformation property 1 is a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that the groupware system with two users is correct. When there are more than two users, the situation is more complex. An operation can be transformed along different, albeit equivalent paths, not necessarily yielding the same result. In the simplest case, an operation can be transformed along the two paths of a simple transformation step. Operation $O_{1}$ may be transformed first with respect to $O_{2}$ and then to $O'_{3}$ yielding $IT(IT(O_{1},O_{2}),O'_{3})$, or it may be transformed first with respect to $O_{3}$ and then to $O'_{2}$ yielding $IT(IT(O_{1},O_{3}),O'_{2})$. Note that different sites might choose different paths for $O_{1}$ to be transformed. So we have to make sure that both paths lead to the same resulting operation:

\begin{defn}
Transformation Property 2: 
$IT(IT(O_{1},O_{2}),O'_{3})$=$IT(IT(O_{1},O_{3}),O'_{2})$
\end{defn}


\subsection{Groupware Architecture Analysis} We consider the architecture of a groupware application from two different point of views. On the one hand, the focus lies on the document replication and on the other, we consider the type of group communication between the participating sites.

\subsubsection{Document replication}

\paragraph{Centralized architecture} In a centralized architecture all data, i.e. the document, resides on a central machine. Client processes at each site are only responsible for passing requests to the central program and for displaying any output sent to them from the central program. The advantage of a centralized scheme is that synchronization is easy. Document state information is consistent since it is located in one place, and events are handled at clients in the same order because they are serialized by the server. Its main drawback is latency, as the message corresponding to any action must pass from the client to the server and back again before response to the action is shown.

\paragraph{Replicated architecture} In a replicated architecture the document is replicated at all participating sites. Client processes at each site (replicas) must coordinate explicitly both local and remote actions, synchronizing all copies of the document. Replicas need only exchange critical state information to keep their copy of the document current. While remote activities may still be delayed, local activities can be processed immediately. Processing bottlenecks are less likely, because each replica is responsible for drawing only the local view. The most significant cost of replication is increased complexity as issues of distributed systems like conflict management, concurrency control, etc. must be handled. 

The \emph{real-time} requirement has led most researchers to adopt a replicated architecture.


\subsubsection{Group Communication}
We consider two types of group communication architectures: unicast and multicast:

\paragraph{Unicast communication} Unicast communication is a two way communication where client processes at each site communicate bidirectionally with a centralized server. The server forwards information from one client to all other clients.

\paragraph{Multicast communication} Mulitcast communication is an $n$ way communication where client processes at each site communicate with all the participating sites directly. It has an enormous growth in terms of the number of communication paths. They grow at the rate of $n(n-1)/2$, where $n$ is the number of clients in the system. As compared to this, systems that use unicast communication have a linear growth. 


\section{History}
{Ellis and Gibbs}~\cite{ellis} were the first to propose an \emph{Operational Transformation} algorithm in 1989. The algorithm is called \emph{dOPT} and is implemented in the \emph{Grove} system. Soon however a flaw was discovered in the original \emph{dOPT} algorithm (by Cormack\cite{cormack95a}). The scenario where \emph{dOPT} failed is called the \emph{dOPT} puzzle. Ressel\cite{ressel96} proposed a new algorithm \emph{adOPTed} in 1996 that solved the original \emph{dOPT} puzzle. {Sun et. al}\cite{sun98a} proposed another algorithm called \emph{GOT} that similarly to \emph{adOPTed} solved the \emph{dOPT} puzzle. {Sun et. al}\cite{sun98b} developed some transformation functions for string-wise operations.

Later research groups\cite{imine03}\cite{imine04} proved the transformation functions of both Ressel\cite{ressel96} and Sun\cite{sun98a} to fail to hold TP2 in certain situations. They proposed new transformation functions they developed using a theorem prover. 

Proving the transformation property 1 (TP1) seems to be rather straightforward. However, proving that a given transformation function holds TP2 appears to be difficult. There are over 100 cases that have to be analyzed (according to {Imine et. al}\cite{imine04}). Imine et. al showed that many proposed transformation functions do not hold TP2. 

Recently, two different ways have been taken to deal with the TP2 problem. One kind of algorithms tries to avoid the need to comply with TP2 altogether (GOT~\cite{sun98a}, SOCT3/4~\cite{suleiman00}, TIBOT\cite{tibot} and NICE~\cite{sun02}). Other research groups~\cite{li04}~\cite{imine04} try to correct the problems in the original transformation functions of GOTO~\cite{sun98b}, adOPTed~\cite{ressel96} and SDT~\cite{sdt}. 


\section{Algorithms}
\label{algos}
In this section we give an overview of the \emph{Operational Transformation} algorithms we could gather. Two important properties on such algorithms are described first.

\paragraph{} The OT algorithm approach consists of two main components:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item The \emph{integration algorithm} which is responsible of receiving, broadcasting and executing operations. It is independent of the type of replica and application.
 \item The \emph{transformation function} is responsible for merging two concurrent operations. It is application dependent. For example, a text editor has different operations than a whiteboard application.
\end{enumerate}

The integration algorithm calls the transformation function when needed. The correctness of the OT approach relies on both the correct integration algorithm as well as on the correct transformation function.
