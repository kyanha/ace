== How to Build the Project ==

There is a build.xml file that can be used to build the project. Before the
build can succeed the following steps must be followed.

1. download maven 2.0 ant tasks from http://maven.apache.org/maven2/ant-tasks.html
   note: you have to get the jar archive from the maven2 download page
2. place the jar file inside the lib directory of your ant installation (ANT_HOME/lib)
   note: the version of ant must be at least 1.6

The jar file contains an ant library that allows maven style dependency download. All
the dependencies are declared inside the build.xml. They are downloaded as soon as
they are needed for the first time and placed in a local repository (${user.home}/.m2).

Once that the jar file is in the correct place, you can simply type

$  ant compile

to compile the project.
