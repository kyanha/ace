<h2>Development</h2>

<p>The source code of the project can be found in our subversion repository.</p>

<pre class="wiki">
svn co http://ace.iserver.ch:81/repos/ace/ace/trunk ace
</pre>

<h3>Trac</h3>
<p>In the first stage of the project we used <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com/">trac</a>, a combined wiki, issue tracker, and repository
browser. Trac is still running, but we do not use it anymore as wiki and
issue tracker. Trac can be found <a href="http://ace.iserver.ch:81/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Jira</h3>
<p>We switched to <a href="http://ace.iserver.ch:8080/jira">Jira</a> as our
issue tracker. At the moment, this issue tracker is only used internally to keep track of open tasks, bugs, and enhancements. To find out more about Jira, visit the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira Product Website.</a>.</p>

<h3>Confluence</h3>
<p>We also use <a href="http://ace.iserver.ch:8080/confluence">Confluence</a> as our wiki. To find out more about Confluence, visit the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence Product Website</a>.</p>
