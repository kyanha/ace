   <h2>User Preferences</h2>
   The package <code>ch.iserver.ace.application.preferences</code> contains abstractions
   to handle user preferences. The core abstraction is the <code>PreferencesStore</code>
   interface. The only implementation is based on <code>java.util.prefs</code> and
   can be found in the {@link JDKPreferencesStore} class. It is possible to register
   listeners with the preferences store through standard add listener methods. These
   listeners are notified whenever a preference entry changes. See the
   {@link PreferenceChangeListener} interface and the 
   {@link PreferenceChangeEvent} class to see how to use the event mechanism.
